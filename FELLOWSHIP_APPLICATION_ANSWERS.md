## How did you hear about the fellowship?
Through Internet

---

## Is this your hometown?
Yes

---

## Do you see your future self here or elsewhere?
I see myself building open-source tools that help people worldwide. I'm from India, but my work serves developers everywhere. Open-source doesn't have borders - I'll work from wherever I can build the best tools. What matters is helping others solve problems, not where I am.

---

## Tell us about the cool stuff you learned on your own.

As an AI Engineer, I kept seeing the same problem: clients had lots of data but couldn't use it for AI. No good solution existed, so I taught myself how to build one.

I learned how to turn unstructured data (PDFs, emails, documents) into knowledge graphs that AI systems can actually understand. I built a system that automatically creates ontologies (formal knowledge structures) - something that usually takes weeks, I can do in hours.

I learned by building: knowledge graphs, entity extraction, relationship mapping, conflict detection. I studied research papers and built a hybrid search system that's 30% more accurate than regular vector search.

I built 29 working modules covering everything from data ingestion to graph construction. Learned distributed systems and scalability by building real systems that need to work.

The turning point: After years building custom solutions for clients, I realized the open-source world needed this. So I quit my job to build it full-time. My work experience showed me the problem; teaching myself showed me how to solve it.

---

## What are you working on now?

**Semantica** - an open-source tool that turns messy data into knowledge graphs that AI systems can understand.

**The Problem:** As an AI Engineer, I kept seeing clients with lots of PDFs, emails, and documents, but their AI systems couldn't use them. AI needs structured knowledge with relationships, but existing tools just process documents separately. This makes AI systems fail, hallucinate, or create duplicates.

**What Semantica Does:** Takes 50+ file formats, automatically finds entities and relationships, builds knowledge graphs, and makes AI systems 30% more accurate. Everything is open-source and free.

**Current Status:** 29 working modules, 50+ tutorials, fully open-source. Built this solo over the past year after quitting my AI Engineer job. Need funding to keep working on it full-time.

**Why It Matters:** This solves the problem I saw every day in production. Developers can build smart AI systems in days instead of months, without being locked into expensive proprietary tools.

---

## What industry would you categorize your company/project in?

**AI Infrastructure / Open-Source Developer Tools**

It's a tool that helps developers build AI systems. More specifically: open-source developer tools for knowledge engineering and AI infrastructure. Semantica helps developers turn data into knowledge graphs that AI systems can use.

---

## Project/company link?
https://github.com/Hawksight-AI/semantica

---

## Do you have any eligible cofounders?
No

I'm working solo right now, but open to building a team as the project grows. The open-source community helps a lot too.

---

## What cool stuff have you worked on in the past?

**As an AI Engineer:**
I spent years building AI systems for companies. I built RAG systems (AI that answers questions from documents), knowledge graphs (connecting information), and semantic search (finding relevant content). I worked with tools like Neo4j and built systems that handle millions of documents.

**The Problem I Kept Seeing:**
Every client had the same issue: lots of PDFs and documents, but their AI couldn't use them. I kept building custom solutions from scratch, which was slow and inefficient. I realized there was no good open-source tool for this.

**Semantica (Current Project):**
So I quit my job and built Semantica - a tool that solves this problem. Over a year, I built:
- 29 working modules that handle the entire process
- Automatic knowledge graph creation
- AI systems that are 30% more accurate
- Quality checks to prevent errors

**Why It Matters:** Everything is open-source and free. This solves the problems I faced every day as an AI Engineer, now available to everyone.

---

## What is the most important problem facing your field?

**The Gap Between Data and AI Systems**

As an AI Engineer, I saw this every day: Companies have tons of PDFs, emails, and documents, but AI systems can't use them. AI needs structured knowledge with connections, but data is just sitting there in files.

**What I Saw:**
- Clients had huge amounts of data but couldn't use it for AI
- I kept building custom solutions, which took weeks
- AI systems failed or gave wrong answers (30% accuracy loss)
- Everything had to be built from scratch

**Why It Matters:**
- Billions wasted on AI projects that fail because of bad data
- 80% of company data is unusable by AI
- Developers have to build everything themselves or pay for expensive tools
- No good free/open-source solution exists

**The Solution:**
Semantica automatically turns messy data into knowledge graphs that AI can understand. Developers can build smart AI systems in days instead of months, without being locked into expensive tools.

**Why Now:**
AI is exploding, but without good data infrastructure, AI systems will keep failing. We have a small window to build this as open-source before big companies lock everyone into their proprietary tools.

## What is the most important problem facing someone else's field?

**Healthcare: Scattered Medical Knowledge**

Healthcare has a huge problem: medical knowledge is spread across millions of research papers, trials, and patient records. There's no way to connect it all, so:

- Doctors can't easily find related research
- Researchers can't connect findings across papers
- AI diagnostic systems lack complete knowledge
- Drug discovery misses important connections
- Patient care suffers from incomplete information

**Why This Matters:**
Medical knowledge doubles every 73 days, but there's no way to connect it. Doctors can't keep up, and AI systems don't have the full picture.

**How Semantica Could Help:**
By building knowledge graphs from medical papers and data, we could create:
- AI systems that understand medical relationships
- Tools that connect research findings
- Better diagnostic systems
- Drug discovery platforms that find hidden connections

**The Bigger Picture:**
This isn't just healthcare - every field with lots of knowledge (legal, research, finance) has the same problem. That's why building open-source tools matters - it helps everyone.

---

## What are you currently obsessed with that is totally unrelated to your project?

**How Humans Organize Information**

I'm fascinated by how people organize knowledge - from ancient libraries to modern systems like Wikipedia. I read about how different cultures structure information, how we've gone from scrolls to digital knowledge, and what it means to "know" something in the age of AI.

This actually connects to my work: Semantica is about organizing information so AI can understand meaning, not just process data. Seeing how humans have organized knowledge throughout history helps me think about how AI should do it.

I love comparing old systems (like library classifications) to modern semantic web standards. There's something interesting about how humans have always tried to organize knowledge.

---

## How do you feel about money?

Money lets me work full-time on what matters: building open-source tools that help others.

**My View:**
- Money enables work, it's not the goal. I quit my AI Engineer job to build Semantica - I could earn more in industry, but chose to build open-source instead.
- I need funding to keep working, not to get rich. $100K can last 12-18 months because I'm solo and efficient.
- Even with funding, Semantica stays 100% open-source. No proprietary features, ever.

**Why Funding Matters:**
I've been using my savings for over a year. To finish Semantica and help the community, I need funding. But the goal isn't money - it's building tools that solve the problems I saw as an AI Engineer.

**The Real Value:**
The real wealth is impact - helping developers build better AI, supporting research, advancing open-source. That's worth more than money. I saw the problems firsthand; now I'm building the solution for everyone.

---

## What are you scared of?

**Missing the chance to build open-source tools before big companies lock everyone in.**

Big tech companies are building semantic tools that will be expensive and lock users in. Once that happens, it's hard to compete. We have maybe 2-3 years.

What worries me: What if I can't finish building before proprietary tools take over? What if developers get locked into expensive solutions before they realize the cost? What if we lose the chance to build trustworthy, open AI?

This fear makes me work harder and faster. Every day counts. That's why I quit my job - waiting costs too much.

The solution: Build now, build open-source, build with the community. The best way to fight proprietary lock-in is a strong open-source alternative.

---

## Tell us something tangible you want.

**$100,000 to work full-time on Semantica for 12-18 months.**

This is specific: Work full-time (no side jobs), build cloud platform, add multi-language support, implement real-time updates, grow community (5K+ GitHub stars, 25+ contributors), integrate with major frameworks.

Budget breakdown: Development 50%, Infrastructure 26%, Community 10%, Research 6%, Operations 4%, Backup 4%. Goals: Cloud platform by Month 6, 5K stars by Month 12, 100+ people using it.

What this enables: Developers can build smart AI systems, researchers get tools they need, companies can use it without being locked in, everyone gets free open-source infrastructure.

The real ask: The money lets me work full-time. What I really want is to enable AI systems that actually understand and reason, not just process data.

Why now: The window is closing. AI is exploding, but if we don't build open-source infrastructure now, big companies will lock everyone in. The $100K is an investment in keeping AI tools open and free for everyone.

## Additional Notes

**Why This Fellowship Matters:**
This fellowship would enable me to focus entirely on Semantica without financial pressure. It's not just about the money—it's about validation that this work matters, that building open-source infrastructure is valuable, that semantic intelligence should be accessible to everyone.

**My Commitment:**
Regardless of funding, Semantica remains 100% open-source. No proprietary features, no vendor lock-in, no strings attached. The funding enables development, but the project belongs to the community.

**Long-Term Vision:**
I want Semantica to become the de-facto open-source semantic layer framework—the infrastructure that enables trustworthy, explainable AI globally. This fellowship is a step toward that vision.
