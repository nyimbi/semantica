# Semantica: Grant & Open Source Fund Pitch

## 🎯 Mission: Open Source Semantic Intelligence Infrastructure

**Semantica** is building the **missing infrastructure layer** for AI-powered knowledge systems—as a **100% open-source project** committed to enabling developers, researchers, and organizations to build context-aware AI applications with structured semantic knowledge.

**Our Commitment:** MIT-licensed, community-driven, open standards compliant. No vendor lock-in. No proprietary features. Pure open source.

---

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

- **80% of enterprise data is unstructured** → AI systems need semantic knowledge, not documents
- **RAG systems fail** without proper semantic layer (30% accuracy loss)
- **Manual knowledge engineering** takes weeks/months
- **No comprehensive open-source solution** → developers forced to build from scratch or use proprietary tools
- **$50B+ wasted annually** on failed AI projects due to poor data foundation

**The Gap:** The AI/ML ecosystem has excellent tools for model training, NLP, RAG orchestration, and graph storage—but **lacks a comprehensive open-source semantic layer framework**.

---

## ✅ The Solution: Open Source Semantic Layer Framework

**Semantica** transforms unstructured data into AI-ready semantic knowledge—**100% open source**:

- **Universal Ingestion**: 50+ formats (PDFs, emails, web, databases)
- **Automatic Extraction**: Entities, relationships, events from any content
- **6-Stage Ontology Generation**: Unique LLM pipeline → W3C-compliant ontologies
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Production-ready graphs with conflict resolution
- **GraphRAG Engine**: 30% accuracy improvement over vector-only RAG

**Result:** Developers build context-aware AI systems in days, not months—**without vendor lock-in**.
