## 🧩 Implementation Example

Here is a general pattern for implementing these use cases:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Input[📄 Data Sources] --> Ingest
    Ingest --> Extract[🧠 Semantic Extraction]
    Extract --> KG[🕸️ Knowledge Graph]
    KG --> App[🚀 Application]
    
    subgraph Application Layer
        App --> Search[Semantic Search]
        App --> RAG[GraphRAG]
        App --> Analytics[Graph Analytics]
    end
```

```python
from semantica import Semantica

# 1. Initialize with domain-specific configuration
semantica = Semantica(domain="finance")

# 2. Ingest Data
docs = semantica.ingest.load("data/", recursive=True)

# 3. Build Knowledge Graph
kg = semantica.kg.build_graph(docs)

# 4. Analyze or Query
insights = semantica.kg.query("MATCH (c:Company)-[:HAS_RISK]->(r:Risk) RETURN c, r")
```
