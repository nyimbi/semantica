Context Engineering Module

This module provides comprehensive context engineering infrastructure for agents,
formalizing context as a graph of connections to enable meaningful agent
understanding and memory. It integrates RAG with knowledge graphs to provide
persistent context for intelligent agents.

Algorithms Used:

Context Graph Construction:
    - Graph Building: Node and edge construction from entities and relationships
    - Entity Extraction: Entity extraction from conversations and text
    - Relationship Extraction: Relationship extraction from conversations
    - Intent Extraction: Intent classification from conversations
    - Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment extraction from conversations
    - Graph Traversal: BFS/DFS for neighbor discovery and multi-hop traversal
    - Graph Indexing: Type-based indexing for efficient node/edge lookup

Agent Memory Management:
    - Vector Embedding: Embedding generation for memory items
    - Vector Search: Similarity search in vector space
    - Keyword Search: Fallback keyword-based search
    - Retention Policy: Time-based memory retention and cleanup
    - Memory Indexing: Deque-based memory index for efficient access
    - Knowledge Graph Integration: Entity and relationship updates to knowledge graph

Context Retrieval:
    - Vector Similarity Search: Cosine similarity in vector space
    - Graph Traversal: Multi-hop graph expansion for related entities
    - Memory Search: Vector and keyword search in memory store
    - Result Ranking: Score-based ranking and merging
    - Deduplication: Content-based result deduplication
    - Hybrid Scoring: Weighted combination of multiple retrieval sources

Entity Linking:
    - URI Generation: Hash-based and text-based URI assignment
    - Text Similarity: Word overlap-based similarity calculation
    - Knowledge Graph Lookup: Entity matching in knowledge graph
    - Cross-Document Linking: Entity linking across multiple documents
    - Bidirectional Linking: Symmetric relationship creation
    - Entity Web Construction: Graph-based entity connection web

Key Features:
    - Context graph construction from entities, relationships, and conversations
    - Agent memory management with RAG integration
    - Entity linking across sources with URI assignment
    - Hybrid context retrieval (vector + graph + memory)
    - Conversation history management
    - Context accumulation and synthesis
    - Graph-based context traversal and querying
    - Method registry for custom context methods
    - Configuration management with environment variables and config files

Main Classes:
    - ContextGraphBuilder: Builds context graphs from various sources
    - ContextNode: Context graph node data structure
    - ContextEdge: Context graph edge data structure
    - AgentMemory: Manages persistent agent memory with RAG
    - MemoryItem: Memory item data structure
    - EntityLinker: Links entities across sources with URIs
    - EntityLink: Entity link data structure
    - LinkedEntity: Linked entity with context
    - ContextRetriever: Retrieves relevant context from multiple sources
    - RetrievedContext: Retrieved context item data structure
    - MethodRegistry: Registry for custom context methods
    - ContextConfig: Configuration manager for context module

Convenience Functions:
    - build_context: Build context graph and manage memory in one call

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.context import build_context, ContextGraphBuilder, AgentMemory
    >>> # Using convenience function
    >>> result = build_context(
    ...     entities=entities,
    ...     relationships=relationships,
    ...     vector_store=vs,
    ...     knowledge_graph=kg
    ... )
    >>> # Using classes directly
    >>> builder = ContextGraphBuilder()
    >>> graph = builder.build_from_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships)
    >>> memory = AgentMemory(vector_store=vs, knowledge_graph=kg)
    >>> memory_id = memory.store("User asked about Python", metadata={"type": "conversation"})
    >>> results = memory.retrieve("Python", max_results=5)
