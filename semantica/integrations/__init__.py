Semantica Integrations Module

Placeholder for future integration adapters with agentic frameworks and SDKs.
Exposes Semantica's semantic intelligence (knowledge graphs, ontologies, provenance
tracking, semantic extraction) as native components within their respective frameworks.

Planned Integrations:
    - Agno Framework (Issue #249): Semantic memory and knowledge graph integration
    - Google ADK (Issue #251): Semantic tools and memory interfaces
    - Claude Agent SDK (Issue #250): Custom tools and hooks for explainable AI

All integrations will be opt-in via pip extras with zero breaking changes.

Status: Placeholder for future implementation
