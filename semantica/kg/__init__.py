Knowledge Graph Management Module

This module provides comprehensive knowledge graph construction and management capabilities
for the Semantica framework, including temporal knowledge graph support for time-aware
knowledge representation, graph analytics, entity resolution, conflict detection, and
provenance tracking.

Algorithms Used:

Knowledge Graph Construction:
    - Graph Building: Entity-relationship graph construction from multiple sources
    - Entity Resolution: Fuzzy string matching, exact matching, semantic similarity matching for duplicate detection
    - Conflict Detection: Value conflict detection (same entity with different property values), relationship conflict detection
    - Conflict Resolution: Highest confidence strategy, source-based resolution
    - Temporal Graph Support: Time-aware edge creation with valid_from/valid_until timestamps
    - Temporal Granularity: Time normalization (second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year)
    - Entity Merging: Property aggregation, metadata merging, provenance tracking
    - Incremental Building: Batch processing for large graphs

Graph Analysis:
    - Degree Centrality: Normalized degree calculation (degree / (n-1)) for connectivity measure
    - Betweenness Centrality: Shortest path counting (BFS-based), path normalization by (n-1)*(n-2)/2
    - Closeness Centrality: Average distance calculation, (n-1) / sum of distances normalization
    - Eigenvector Centrality: Power iteration method, adjacency matrix eigenvalue computation, convergence tolerance
    - Community Detection: Louvain algorithm (greedy modularity optimization), Leiden algorithm (with refinement step)
    - Overlapping Communities: K-clique community detection, dense subgraph detection
    - Modularity Calculation: Q = (1/2m) * Σ(A_ij - k_i*k_j/2m) * δ(c_i, c_j)
    - Graph Connectivity: DFS-based connected component detection, component size analysis
    - Bridge Detection: Edge removal and connectivity change detection
    - Path Finding: BFS shortest path algorithm, all-pairs shortest paths computation
    - Graph Density: E / (n*(n-1)/2) calculation for undirected graphs
    - Structure Classification: Density-based classification (sparse, moderate, dense, disconnected)

Entity Resolution:
    - Duplicate Detection: Similarity-based grouping using threshold matching
    - Fuzzy Matching: String similarity algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler)
    - Semantic Matching: Embedding-based similarity for semantic entity matching

    - ID Normalization: Canonical ID assignment for merged entities

Conflict Detection:
    - Value Conflict Detection: Property value comparison, unique value set extraction
    - Relationship Conflict Detection: Relationship property comparison, conflict identification
    - Source Tracking: Multi-source conflict tracking, provenance-based conflict resolution
    - Conflict Categorization: Value conflicts vs relationship conflicts

Graph Validation:
    - Entity Validation: Required field checking (ID, type), unique ID verification
    - Relationship Validation: Source/target reference validation, required field checking
    - Consistency Checking: Type consistency verification, circular relationship detection (DFS-based cycle detection)
