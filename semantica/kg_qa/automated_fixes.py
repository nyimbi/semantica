Automated Fixes Module

This module provides automated fixing capabilities for the Semantica framework,
enabling automatic resolution of common knowledge graph quality issues.

Key Features:
    - Duplicate entity and relationship fixing
    - Inconsistency resolution
    - Missing property completion
    - Conflicting property merging
    - Conflict and disagreement resolution

Main Classes:
    - AutomatedFixer: Main automated fixing engine
    - AutoMerger: Automatic merging of duplicates and conflicts
    - AutoResolver: Automatic conflict and inconsistency resolution

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg_qa import AutomatedFixer
    >>> fixer = AutomatedFixer()
    >>> result = fixer.fix_duplicates(knowledge_graph)
    >>> result = fixer.fix_missing_properties(knowledge_graph, schema)
