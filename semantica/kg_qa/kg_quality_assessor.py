KG Quality Assessor Module

This module provides the main quality assessment coordination for the Semantica
framework, integrating all quality assurance components to provide comprehensive
quality assessment and reporting.

Key Features:
    - Overall quality assessment
    - Quality report generation
    - Quality issue identification
    - Consistency checking
    - Completeness validation

Main Classes:
    - KGQualityAssessor: Main quality assessment coordinator
    - ConsistencyChecker: Consistency validation engine
    - CompletenessValidator: Completeness validation engine

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg_qa import KGQualityAssessor
    >>> assessor = KGQualityAssessor()
    >>> score = assessor.assess_overall_quality(knowledge_graph)
    >>> report = assessor.generate_quality_report(knowledge_graph, schema)
    >>> issues = assessor.identify_quality_issues(knowledge_graph, schema)
