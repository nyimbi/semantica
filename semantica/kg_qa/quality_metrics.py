Quality Metrics Module

This module provides comprehensive quality metrics calculation for the Semantica
framework, enabling quantitative assessment of knowledge graph quality across
multiple dimensions.

Key Features:
    - Overall quality score calculation
    - Entity quality metrics
    - Relationship quality metrics
    - Completeness metrics (entity, relationship, property)
    - Consistency metrics (logical, temporal, hierarchical)

Main Classes:
    - QualityMetrics: Overall quality metrics calculator
    - CompletenessMetrics: Completeness metrics calculator
    - ConsistencyMetrics: Consistency metrics calculator

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg_qa import QualityMetrics
    >>> metrics = QualityMetrics()
    >>> score = metrics.calculate_overall_score(knowledge_graph)
    >>> entity_score = metrics.calculate_entity_quality(entities)
