Quality Reporting Module

This module provides comprehensive quality reporting capabilities for the
Semantica framework, enabling generation of quality reports, issue tracking,
and improvement suggestions.

Key Features:
    - Quality report generation
    - Issue identification and tracking
    - Improvement suggestions generation
    - Report export (JSON, YAML, HTML)
    - Issue management (add, get, list, resolve)

Main Classes:
    - QualityReporter: Quality report generation engine
    - IssueTracker: Issue tracking and management
    - ImprovementSuggestions: Improvement suggestions generator

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg_qa import QualityReporter
    >>> reporter = QualityReporter()
    >>> report = reporter.generate_report(knowledge_graph, quality_metrics)
    >>> json_report = reporter.export_report(report, format="json")
