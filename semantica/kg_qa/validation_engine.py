Validation Engine Module

This module provides comprehensive validation capabilities for the Semantica
framework, enabling rule-based and constraint-based validation of knowledge graphs.

Key Features:
    - Rule-based validation
    - Constraint-based validation
    - Custom validation rules
    - Validation result reporting

Main Classes:
    - ValidationEngine: Main validation engine
    - RuleValidator: Rule-based validation
    - ConstraintValidator: Constraint-based validation

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg_qa import ValidationEngine
    >>> engine = ValidationEngine()
    >>> result = engine.validate(knowledge_graph, rules=[rule1, rule2])
    >>> engine.add_rule(custom_rule)
