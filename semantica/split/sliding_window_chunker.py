Sliding Window Chunker Module

This module provides fixed-size chunking with overlap capabilities using
a sliding window approach, with optional boundary preservation for better
text coherence.

Key Features:
    - Fixed-size sliding window chunking
    - Configurable overlap and stride
    - Boundary preservation (word/sentence)
    - Fixed-size or boundary-aware modes
    - Chunk metadata tracking

Main Classes:
    - SlidingWindowChunker: Main sliding window chunking coordinator

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.split import SlidingWindowChunker
    >>> chunker = SlidingWindowChunker(chunk_size=1000, overlap=200)
    >>> chunks = chunker.chunk(text, preserve_boundaries=True)
    >>> overlap_chunks = chunker.chunk_with_overlap(text, overlap_size=300)
